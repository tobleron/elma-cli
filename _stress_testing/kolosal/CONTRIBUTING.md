## Coding Guidelines

- **Language Standard:**  
  We use C++17. Make sure your code is compatible with this standard.
- **Code Style:**  
  Follow the style of existing code. Consistency is key!
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
  - Document non-obvious code sections with comments.
- **Directory Structure:**  
  - Place new features or modules in the appropriate directory (e.g., `source/`, `include/`, or as a new folder if it’s a standalone component).
  - Update or add documentation in the relevant section if you modify functionality.
- **Documentation:**  
  Update README and inline comments where necessary.
- **Testing:**  
  If applicable, include unit tests or instructions on how to verify your changes.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. A suggested format is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

Where:
- **type**:  
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Other changes (build process, auxiliary tools, etc.)
- **scope**: A brief description of the affected area (e.g., `build`, `ui`, `engine`).
- **subject**: A concise description of the changes.

*Example:*

```
feat(ui): add dark mode support to settings panel

This commit introduces dark mode options in the settings. The UI components have been updated, and relevant assets have been added.
```

  Follow the [compiling instructions](#how-to-compile) in the README to ensure your changes build correctly.
- **Run the Application**  
  Verify that your changes work as expected by running the application.
- **Automated Tests**  
  If you add tests:
  - Include instructions for running them.
