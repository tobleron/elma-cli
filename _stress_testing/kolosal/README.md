## Prerequisites

1. **CMake 3.14 or above**  
   Download from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).
2. **A C++17-compatible compiler**  
   - For Windows, Visual Studio 2019/2022 (MSVC) or [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) with GCC 7+.
   - For other platforms, an equivalent compiler supporting C++17.
3. **Git** (optional, but recommended for cloning and submodule management).
4. **OpenSSL**, **CURL**  
   - On Windows, you can place the pre-built bins/headers inside `external/openssl` and `external/curl` (or anywhere you prefer, just ensure `CMakeLists.txt` sees them).
5. **(Optional) Vulkan SDK** if you plan to use the Vulkan-based inference engine.

## Cloning and Preparing the Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Genta-Technology/Kolosal.git
   cd KolosalAI
   ```

2. **Update submodules**:  
   If any external libraries are handled as Git submodules, initialize them:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Pull Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   glt lfs pull
   ```

3. **Check external dependencies**:  
   Ensure the `external` folder contains:
   - `curl` with `include/`, `lib/`, and `bin/` (Windows).
   - `openssl` or that OpenSSL is installed system-wide.
   - The `genta-personal` engine in place if not fetched from elsewhere.

4. **Folder structure verification**:  
   Verify that folders like `nativefiledialog-extended`, `imgui`, etc., are present inside `external/`.

## Configuring the Project with CMake

You can perform either an in-source or out-of-source build, but **out-of-source** is recommended. Below is an example of an out-of-source build:

1. **Create a build folder**:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. **Run CMake**:  
   By default, this will generate build files for your platform’s default generator (e.g., Visual Studio solution files on Windows, Makefiles on Linux, etc.):

   ```bash
   cmake -S .. -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

   or explicitly (for Visual Studio multi-config):

   ```bash
   cmake -S .. -B . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
   ```

   - `-DDEBUG=ON` can be used if you want to build a debug version:

     ```bash
     cmake -S .. -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DDEBUG=ON
     ```

3. **Check for any errors** during configuration, such as missing libraries or headers. Resolve them by installing or copying the required dependencies into the correct location.

## Building the Application

After successful configuration:

- **On Windows with Visual Studio**:  
  Open the generated `.sln` file inside `build/` and build the solution. Or build from the command line using:

  ```bash
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

- **On other platforms** (e.g., using Make or Ninja):

  ```bash
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

> **Note**:  
> The `POST_BUILD` commands in `CMakeLists.txt` will copy the necessary DLLs, fonts, assets, and models into the final output folder (e.g., `build/Release/` or `build/Debug/`, depending on your generator).

## Running the Application

1. **Locate the output**:  
   Once the build completes, you should find the executable (e.g., `KolosalDesktop.exe` on Windows) in a directory such as:
   - `build/Release/` (Visual Studio).
   - `build/` (single-config generators like Make).

2. **Check for required files**:  
   The post-build commands should have copied:
   - **Fonts** (`/fonts` folder next to the exe).
   - **Assets** (`/assets` folder next to the exe).
   - **Models** (`/models` folder next to the exe).
   - **OpenSSL** and **InferenceEngine** DLLs (Windows).
   - **cURL** DLL(s) (Windows).

   Make sure these folders and files are present in the same directory as `KolosalDesktop.exe`.

3. **Double-click or run from terminal**:

   ```bash
   cd build/Release
   ./KolosalDesktop.exe
   ```

4. **Enjoy Kolosal AI**!

## Troubleshooting

1. **OpenSSL or CURL not found**  
   - Make sure you have them installed or placed in `external/openssl` and `external/curl` respectively.  
   - Check environment variables like `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` or `CURL_ROOT_DIR` if needed.  
   - Update `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` if you’re placing these libraries somewhere non-standard.

2. **InferenceEngine libraries not found**  
   - Verify the path `external/genta-personal/lib` actually contains `InferenceEngineLib.lib` or `InferenceEngineLibVulkan.lib` (on Windows).  
   - Adjust `find_library` paths in `CMakeLists.txt` if your structure differs.

3. **Missing Vulkan SDK**  
   - If you plan to use the Vulkan-based inference engine, ensure Vulkan SDK is installed and available in your PATH or that CMake can find it.

4. **ImGui not found**  
   - Ensure `external/imgui` folder is not empty.  
   - If you see compilation errors referencing ImGui headers, check that `target_include_directories` in `CMakeLists.txt` still points to the correct path.

5. **Resource or Icon issues on non-Windows**  
   - The `assets/resource.rc` file is Windows-specific. For Linux/macOS builds, you can comment out or remove references to `.rc` if they cause issues.

6. **Runtime errors** due to missing DLLs or dynamic libraries  
   - Confirm that the post-build step copies all required `.dll` files next to the executable.  
   - On Linux/macOS, ensure `.so`/`.dylib` are in the library search path or same folder.
